Description: AMEND (Active Module identification using Experimental data and Network Diffusion) is an algorithm designed to find a subset of connected nodes in a molecular interaction network that have large experimental values from a high-throughput assay. It makes use of random walk with restart to create node weights, and a heuristic approach for solving the Maximum-weight Connected Subgraph problem using these weights. This is performed iteratively until an optimal subnetwork (i.e., module) is found.
