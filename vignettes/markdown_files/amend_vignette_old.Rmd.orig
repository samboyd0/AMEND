# Introduction

A powerful approach for the analysis of omics data is to integrate them with molecular interaction networks. Specifically, the integration of microarray/RNA-seq data with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has emerged as an effective way to elucidate important genes involved in a biological process. These approaches are often called active module identification (AMI) methods and have the goal of finding a subset of genes (either connected or disconnected) in the PPI network that are relevant to the biological conditions of the experiment.

AMEND is an AMI method that takes as input a PPI network and gene-wise experimental scores (e.g., log fold change) and returns a connected module. AMEND relies on random walk with restart (RWR) and a heuristic solution to the maximum-weight connected subgraph (MWCS) problem to iteratively filter out genes until an optimal subnetwork is found. At each iteration, the current network is input into RWR, with the gene-wise experimental scores serving as seed values. This produces node weights, which are shifted downwards by a certain quantile (called the filtering rate), resulting in both positive and negative node weights. These weights are used to find a maximum-weight connected subgraph. AMEND uses a heuristic solution first implemented in the [BioNet](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BioNet.html) package. This produces a subnetwork, which is the input for the next iteration. Each subnetwork is scored by the product of the mean standardized experimental scores (standardized w.r.t. all genes in original network) and the mean core-clustering coefficient (a measure of node connectivity). The process stops when there is no change in subnetwork between iterations or when only 2 nodes remain in the subnetwork. The subnetwork with the largest score is returned. 

A key concept in AMEND is the filtering rate, which determines how the untreated RWR scores are shifted before input into the heuristic MWCS solution. The filtering rate is actually a quantile of the untreated RWR scores. As the quantile decreases, each RWR score is subtracted by a smaller number, resulting in fewer negatively weighted nodes, which results in fewer genes filtered out by the MWCS solution. In this sense, the quantile used to shift the untreated RWR scores is a filtering rate. This filtering rate follows an exponential decay schedule, which has two hyperparameters: the starting filtering rate and the decay value. 

The decay parameter determines the rate at which the shifting quantile decreases. This value is determined by simulation. The decay is set to the maximum value that will allow the algorithm to arrive at a subnetwork of size $n$. If the decay is too large, the filtering rate will approach zero too quickly. This causes the algorithm to stop early since no nodes will be removed with a filtering rate of zero. The parameter $n$ is set by the user and approximates the size of the final module. 

The primary function is `run_AMEND()`, which determines the optimal starting filtering rate by particle swarm optimization (PSO) if no value is given, and then implements the AMEND algorithm with this starting filtering rate, returning a connected subnetwork.  

# Installation

AMEND is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/samboyd0/AMEND) and can be installed by running the following code.

```{r install, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("samboyd0/AMEND", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Example

This example will focus on a gene expression microarray experiment to illustrate a typical use case for AMEND. 

## GLUT4 Data Description

The dataset that will be used here is a GLUT4 knockout-overexpression (KO-OX) microarray experiment in mouse adipose tissue and is available on the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus under accession [GSE35378](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE35378). GLUT4 is a glucose transporter protein involved in the uptake of glucose into the cell. The experiment involved 4 groups of 3 mice each: GLUT4 KO, KO control, GLUT4 OX, and OX control.  

```{r getGEO}
# Accessing data from NCBI GEO 
gse1 <- GEOquery::getGEO("GSE35378", GSEMatrix = TRUE)
data <- Biobase::exprs(gse1[[1]])
head(data)
```

## Equivalent Change Index

AMEND was developed to accommodate a recently introduced metric, the equivalent change index (ECI). The ECI measures the extent to which a gene is equivalently or inversely expressed between two treatment-control comparisons. It ranges between -1 and 1, with a value of -1 indicating changes in expression in exactly opposing ways (e.g., expression was halved between groups for one experiment but doubled for the other), and a value of 1 indicating changes in expression in exactly equivalent ways (e.g., expression was doubled between groups for both experiments). Formally, the ECI for gene $i$ is $$\lambda_i=sign(\beta_{i1}*\beta_{i2})\frac{min(|\beta_{i1}|,|\beta_{i2}|)}{max(|\beta_{i1}|,|\beta_{i2}|)}(1-max(p_{i1}, p_{i2}))$$ where $\beta_{ij}$ represents the log fold change and $p_{ij}$ the p-value for gene $i$ from experiment $j$. 

## Differential Expression Analysis 

This section will show the steps taken to generate the ECIs and log fold changes for the GLUT4 dataset. Preprocessing involves background subtracting and normalizing, as well as checking for zero sample variances. 

```{r preprocessing}
# Background-subtracting and normalizing with oligo package
re <- oligo::basicRMA(data, row.names(data))

# checking for genes with zero sample variance
r <- matrix()
for(i in 1:nrow(re)){
  t <- sd(re[i,])
  if(t == 0){
    r <- c(r, i)
  }
}
var_check <- r[-1]
```

Next, the _limma_ package is used to fit linear models to the expression data. $log_2$ fold changes are obtained for the appropriate group comparisons, along with their unadjusted p-values. 

```{r DE}
# Design matrix
groups = c(rep("OX", 3), rep("OX_ctrl", 3), rep("KO", 3), rep("KO_ctrl", 3))
X = stats::model.matrix(~0+groups)
colnames(X) = sort(unique(groups))

# Fitting linear models
fit <- limma::lmFit(re[-var_check,], design = X)

# Getting contrast coefficents for KO vs. Ctrl 1
cnt_KO = limma::makeContrasts(contrasts = "KO-KO_ctrl", levels = colnames(X))
fit_KO = limma::contrasts.fit(fit, contrasts = cnt_KO)
fit_KO <- limma::eBayes(fit_KO)
tt_KO <- limma::topTable(fit_KO, number = 100000, adjust.method = "BH")
esize_KO <- tt_KO$logFC
pval_KO <- tt_KO$P.Value
names(esize_KO) <- row.names(tt_KO)
names(pval_KO) <- row.names(tt_KO)
head(esize_KO)

# Getting contrast coefficents for OX vs. Ctrl 2
cnt_OX = limma::makeContrasts(contrasts = "OX-OX_ctrl", levels = colnames(X))
fit_OX = limma::contrasts.fit(fit, contrasts = cnt_OX)
fit_OX <- limma::eBayes(fit_OX)
tt_OX <- limma::topTable(fit_OX, number = 100000, adjust.method = "BH")
esize_OX <- tt_OX$logFC
pval_OX <- tt_OX$P.Value
names(esize_OX) <- row.names(tt_OX)
names(pval_OX) <- row.names(tt_OX)
head(esize_OX)
```

We are now able to calculate the ECIs for each probe in the microarray experiment using the R package _ECEA_, which can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreyat/ECEA) with the following code: `devtools::install_github("jeffreyat/ECEA")`. 

```{r ECI, eval = requireNamespace("ECEA")}
# Getting ECI values for each gene
eci <- ECEA::getECI(smd1 = esize_OX, smd2 = esize_KO, p1 = pval_OX, p2 = pval_KO)
eci <- data.frame(ECI = eci, row.names = names(eci))
```

The probe IDs are now mapped to gene symbols. Along with the ECI, we will also extract the $log_2$ fold changes for the GLUT4 KO vs. Control groups for downstream analysis.

```{r mapping}
# Mapping probe identifier to gene symbol & aggregating ECI values and logFC values for KO vs. Ctrl
datFC = data.frame(logFC = tt_KO$logFC * (1 - tt_KO$P.Value), row.names = row.names(tt_KO))
dat <- eci
sym_map <- mgu74av2.db::mgu74av2SYMBOL

# Map the probes
genes <- unlist(as.list(sym_map[rownames(dat)]))

# Remove probes that didn't map
genes <- na.omit(genes)
common <- intersect(names(genes), rownames(dat))
genes <- genes[common]
dat <- dat[common,]
datFC = datFC[common,]

# Aggregate probes... take median ECI if multiple probes map to same gene
dat <- aggregate(dat, by = list(genes), FUN = median)
names(dat) <- c("Gene", "ECI")
row.names(dat) <- dat$Gene
dat <- dat %>% dplyr::select(-Gene)

# Aggregate probes... take median logFC if multiple probes map to same gene
datFC <- aggregate(datFC, by = list(genes), FUN = median)
names(datFC) <- c("Gene", "logFC")
row.names(datFC) <- datFC$Gene
datFC <- datFC %>% dplyr::select(-Gene)
```


## Protein-Protein Interaction Network

For this example, a _mus musculus_ PPI network is downloaded from STRING (v11.0). Edges appear twice in the downloaded file, necessitating a helper function to remove the duplicate edges. Only interactions with a confidence score $\ge$ 0.8 are kept.

```{r PPI, eval = file.exists("/Users/samboyd/Documents/GRA/Network Analysis/AMEND/R_package/10090.protein.links.v11.0.txt")}
# Getting mapping between Mouse Gene Symbols <--> Ensembl Peptide IDs
gene_symbols <- row.names(dat)
ensembl <- biomaRt::useMart("ensembl", dataset = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl")
mapping <- biomaRt::getBM(attributes=c("mgi_symbol", "ensembl_peptide_id"),
                          filters = "mgi_symbol",
                          values = gene_symbols,
                          mart = ensembl)
mapping <- mapping %>% dplyr::filter(ensembl_peptide_id != "")

# Function for removing the duplicate edges from String PPI network 
remove_duplicate_edges = function(x){
  g = igraph::graph_from_edgelist(as.matrix(x[,1:2]), directed = F)
  igraph::E(g)$weight = x[,3] / 1000
  adjM = as.matrix(igraph::as_adjacency_matrix(g, attr = "weight", sparse = T)) / 2
  g = igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adjM, mode = "undirected", weighted = TRUE)
  el = igraph::as_edgelist(g)
  return(cbind(el, igraph::E(g)$weight))
}

# Loading in mus musculus PPIN from String v11.0... 
# Can be downloaded from STRING website, but make sure you're on the right version
file_path = "/Users/samboyd/Documents/GRA/Network Analysis/AMEND/R_package/10090.protein.links.v11.0.txt"
ppi = data.table::fread(file = file_path,
                        header = TRUE, sep = " ") %>%
  dplyr::filter(combined_score >= 800) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(protein1 = do.call(c, lapply(strsplit(protein1, "\\."), function(x) x[2])),
         protein2 = do.call(c, lapply(strsplit(protein2, "\\."), function(x) x[2])))  %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  remove_duplicate_edges()
head(ppi)
```

Not all genes will map to a protein in the PPI network. Conversely, some proteins won't correspond to a gene in the experiment. Only genes and proteins that have a mapping will be kept, thus ensuring that each node in the network has an experimental score (e.g., ECI or log fold change).

```{r ppi_mapping}
# Keeping only genes that map to a protein in PPIN
mapping = mapping %>%
  dplyr::mutate(ppi = ensembl_peptide_id %in% ppi[,1] | ensembl_peptide_id %in% ppi[,2]) %>%
  dplyr::filter(ppi) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(mgi_symbol) %>%
  dplyr::filter(row_number() == 1) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# Keeping only proteins that map to a gene in the experiment
ppi = ppi[ppi[,1] %in% mapping$ensembl_peptide_id & ppi[,2] %in% mapping$ensembl_peptide_id,]
```

The input network for AMEND is required to be connected, so we will take the largest connected component. The ECIs and $log_2$ fold changes are then set as vertex attributes. 

```{r getGraph}
# Getting largest connected component of PPIN as an igraph object
glut4_graph = igraph::graph_from_edgelist(as.matrix(ppi[,1:2]), directed = FALSE)
igraph::E(glut4_graph)$weight = as.numeric(ppi[,3])
igraph::V(glut4_graph)$symbol = mapping$mgi_symbol[match(igraph::V(glut4_graph)$name, mapping$ensembl_peptide_id)]
if(!igraph::is_connected(glut4_graph)){
  l = igraph::decompose(glut4_graph)
  glut4_graph = l[[which.max(do.call(c, lapply(l, igraph::vcount)))]]
}

# Setting vertex attribute ECI and logFC (logFC for KO vs. Ctrl)
igraph::V(glut4_graph)$ECI = dat$ECI[match(igraph::V(glut4_graph)$symbol, row.names(dat))]
igraph::V(glut4_graph)$logFC = datFC$logFC[match(igraph::V(glut4_graph)$symbol, row.names(datFC))]
glut4_graph
```

`run_AMEND()` can also work with an adjacency matrix and a vector of node scores, instead of a graph.

```{r getOtherData}
# Getting adjacency matrix from graph
glut4_adjM = igraph::as_adjacency_matrix(glut4_graph, attr = "weight", sparse = T)
glut4_adjM[1:6,1:6]

# Creating vector of gene-wise experimental scores
eci_scores = igraph::V(glut4_graph)$ECI
logFC_KO = igraph::V(glut4_graph)$logFC
head(eci_scores)
head(logFC_KO)
```

## Running AMEND with ECI

Now that we have analyzed our microarray data and obtained a PPI network, we can continue with the active module identification step. It is important to clarify the biological question of interset that we want to answer. For the GLUT4 KO-OX experiment, it may be of interest to know which genes are affected in opposing ways by the two treatments. A gene that is up-regulated in the KO-control arm and down-regulated in the OX-control arm suggests a close association of that gene with GLUT4.
The ECI is well suited to answer this type of question. Since we are interested in inversely regulated genes, we will want to set `data.type = "ECI"` and `eci.direction = "negative"`. We will set `n = 25` to specify the approximate size of the final module.

The `normalize` argument specifies how to normalize the adjacency matrix for random walk with restart (RWR). `normalize = "core"` will use node coreness to normalize the adjacecy matrix. The seed.weight argument specifies how to transform the ECI values for use as seed values in RWR. Seed values must be non-negative, but ECI has a range of $[-1,1]$, necessitating some transformation. The scheme used in AMEND is to take the absolute value of the ECIs, then weight the values _not_ in the direction of interest by some constant in $[0,1]$. For example, when interested in negative ECIs, $seed.weight = 0.5$ translates into weighting a positive ECI gene half that of a negative ECI gene of equal magnitude. 

```{r runECI}
# Using the igraph object as input
module = AMEND::run_AMEND(graph = glut4_graph, n = 25, data.type = "ECI", eci.direction = "negative", 
                   normalize = "core", seed.weight = 0.5, random_seed = 1)

# Can also use the adjacency matrix and vector of node scores
if(0){
  module = AMEND::run_AMEND(adj_matrix = glut4_adjM, node_scores = eci_scores, n = 25, data.type = "ECI", 
                     eci.direction = "negative", normalize = "core", seed.weight = 0.5, random_seed = 1)
}
```

Let's inspect the module returned by `run_AMEND()`. A named list is returned containing the final module, module score, a list of node names contained in the intermediate subnetworks, network statistics for all iterations, the runtime, and a list of the input parameters. 

```{r inspectECI}
# The final module
module$module

# data.frame of network stats for all iterations
module$stats

# Runtime
module$time
```

## Running AMEND with log fold change 

AMEND can also accommodate log fold changes. We have log fold changes for the GLUT4 KO vs. control DE analysis. Suppose we are interested in genes with large log fold changes, regardless of direction. Then we would set `data.type = "logFC"` and `logFC.direction = "both"`.

```{r runLogFC}
# Using the igraph object as input
module2 = AMEND::run_AMEND(graph = glut4_graph, n = 25, data.type = "logFC", logFC.direction = "both", 
                   normalize = "core", seed.weight = 0.5, random_seed = 1)

# Can also use the adjacency matrix and vector of node scores
if(0){
  module2 = AMEND::run_AMEND(adj_matrix = glut4_adjM, node_scores = logFC_KO, n = 25, data.type = "logFC", 
                      logFC.direction = "both", normalize = "core", seed.weight = 0.5, random_seed = 1)
}
```

Here are the results. 

```{r inspectLogFC}
# The final module
module2$module

# data.frame of network stats for all iterations
module2$stats

# Runtime
module2$time
```
